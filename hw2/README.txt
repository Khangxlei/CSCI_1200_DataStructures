material, etc.) you consulted in completing this assignment.

cplusplus.com

Remember: Your implementation for this assignment must be done on your

ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  ~18-20 hours



DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CREATIVE STATISTIC:
I have made so that my custom output will print out a leaderboard based on BOTH
number of strikes and spares. Although it would be easy to print the leaderboard
of strikes first, then spares, I decided to print the two leaderboards
next to each other, for ease of observation and how it looks. You can use 
any file to test this, but the 2010_US_Open.txt works the best with its abundant
amount of players' records.

Sample output:
/hw02.exe example.txt output.txt custom
**inside output.txt**

    STRIKES     	     SPARES
